This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
plot(iris)
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
x = seq(1,10)
length(x)
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
plot(mpg$cty,mpg$displ)
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
